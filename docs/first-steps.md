* Connect your Pi by plugging it into the **inner** micro USB plug (the outer plug is a power supply only).

* `ssh` into `pi@raspberrypi.local`. The default hostname will be provided. The default password is `raspberry`.

* From your home directory, run `python Adafruit_Python_SSD1306/examples/buttons.py`. You should see shapes representing your joystick and buttons on the display and the display should respond when you press each button.

If for some reason you can't run the example script above, curl up into a ball and wait until someone comes to your rescue.
