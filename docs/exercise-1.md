### Exercise 1 - Runtime Stats Layout

Create a `RuntimeStatsLayout` that displays the title and the following stats on the display:

* Available processors
* Free memory
* Max memory
* Total memory

Then add it to the `primaryLayouts` in the `LayoutFactory`.

__Hint:__ The object you can use to get these stats rhymes with 'funtime' :)

__Bonus:__ Make the display refresh every second rather than when you initially switch to the layout.

__Success Criteria:__ Displaying a screen with all the above runtime stats.
